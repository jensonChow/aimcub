# Aimcub Handoff

Last updated: 2026-07-06
Branch: `main`

## Current Session

- Redesigned the Desktop New Aim composer into a Claude-inspired prompt well.
- The top-level New Aim surface now uses a single large rounded composer with the aim question as the placeholder, no separate heading above it, a bottom toolbar, a plus icon for optional context, and an icon-only arrow submit button.
- Optional context now expands from the plus button instead of always taking vertical space in the default composer.
- The composer focus state is quieter, with a neutral border instead of a strong blue ring; enabled submit uses a local warm orange action color.
- Updated Desktop design-system memory with the durable Claude-inspired prompt-well requirement.
- Refreshed root `Aimcub.app` from the latest Electron 43 folder-style Desktop build.

## Current State

- Work is prepared directly on `main`; no separate feature branch merge is needed.
- The focused commit for this session was pushed to `origin/main`.
- Root `Aimcub.app`, `apps/desktop/out`, and `apps/desktop/dist` were refreshed locally and remain ignored build artifacts.
- Visual QA used the dev Electron app and refreshed root Electron app through Computer Use at normal and narrow desktop window sizes.

## Verification

Passed:

- `COREPACK_HOME=/private/tmp/aimcub-corepack PATH=/Users/jenson/.local/node/bin:$PATH pnpm --filter @app/desktop test -- App.test.tsx`
- `COREPACK_HOME=/private/tmp/aimcub-corepack PATH=/Users/jenson/.local/node/bin:$PATH pnpm --filter @app/desktop typecheck`
- `git diff --check`
- `COREPACK_HOME=/private/tmp/aimcub-corepack PATH=/Users/jenson/.local/node/bin:$PATH pnpm build`
- `COREPACK_HOME=/private/tmp/aimcub-corepack PATH=/Users/jenson/.local/node/bin:$PATH pnpm test`
- `COREPACK_HOME=/private/tmp/aimcub-corepack PATH=/Users/jenson/.local/node/bin:$PATH pnpm typecheck`
- `COREPACK_HOME=/private/tmp/aimcub-corepack PATH=/Users/jenson/.local/node/bin:$PATH pnpm lint`
- `COREPACK_HOME=/private/tmp/aimcub-corepack PATH=/Users/jenson/.local/node/bin:$PATH pnpm core:purity`
- `ELECTRON_BUILDER_CACHE=/private/tmp/aimcub-electron-builder-cache COREPACK_HOME=/private/tmp/aimcub-corepack PATH=/Users/jenson/.local/node/bin:$PATH pnpm desktop:pack`
- `ditto apps/desktop/dist/mac-arm64/Aimcub.app Aimcub.app`
- Visual QA in Electron dev app: New Aim rendered as a Claude-style single prompt well, enabled state showed the orange arrow button, optional context expanded from the plus button, and the layout stayed stable at 640 x 520.
- Visual QA in the refreshed root Electron app: Chinese New Aim placeholder, plus button, ready state, and orange arrow button rendered correctly.

Notes:

- MCP worker tests may log the expected missing-Supabase opaque-error path while passing.

## Next Session Prompt

```text
Continue from `main`. Start by reading AGENTS.md, docs/handoff.md, and docs/memory/README.md, then load only task-relevant module memory. For repo-changing sessions, run the full verification suite, refresh root Aimcub.app from the packaged Desktop output, update docs/handoff.md, create a focused commit, push, and merge completed branch work into main unless the user explicitly opts out.
Current `main` should be synced with `origin/main`; if it is not, inspect `git status --short --branch` before continuing.
```
